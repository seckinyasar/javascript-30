            <p>- The Merovingian </p>



            <p class="mt-32">The Merovingian (sometimes called The Frenchman) is an old program that resides within the Matrix. Self-described as a "trafficker of information", The Merovingian behaves much as a leader of a powerful organized crime syndicate. He and his wife Persephone operate a smuggling ring providing a haven for exiled programs in the Matrix. The Merovingian is described as an "Operating System" by The Kid in his blog incorporated in The Matrix Online, although this presumably describes his role pre-Exile rather than his current function.</p>

            <p class="text-3xl mt-12">History</p>
            <hr class="mb-2"> 
            <p>The Merovingian's history seems deeper than his appearances and material trappings. Described by the Oracle as "one of the oldest of us", The Merovingian came to the Matrix "long ago" with his wife, Persephone.</p>
          
            <p class="mt-4">Preferring to speak in French - as its eloquence and fervour is equatable to that of "silk," and further living an opulent life, - The Merovingian desired to displace the Oracle; he even endeavoured to the extent of acquiring her "termination code" to achieve such, but was unsuccessful. Rama Kandra begged him to save his daughter Sati from deletion in exchange for the termination code for the outer shell of The Oracle. At some point, The Merovingian most likely saved Seraph from deletion. And when Seraph later realized The Merovingian's malicious intentions, Seraph betrayed him and sided with The Oracle and adopted the obligation as her bodyguard, protecting The Oracle - and also Sati, from her enemies such as The Merovingian and, possibly, from Agents. Also at some point in his life, an exiled program called The General betrayed The Merovingian. During his encounters with Neo, he explicates his anticipation of his arrival - moreover, that he has frequently encountered and fought his predecessors - previous 'The Ones,' and survived each encounter.

            <h1 class="mt-10 text-3xl">Meeting at the Le Vrai Restaurant</h1>
            <hr class="mb-2">
            <img src="/13-Slide-in-on-Scroll/assets/Neo_w_Mero.JPG-DQHGccuZ.webp" class="align-left slide-in "/>,
            <p>At the Le Vrai restaurant, The Merovingian met with Neo, Trinity, & Morpheus to discuss the exchange of The Keymaker - as The Oracle had counseled to Neo as critical to the continuation of the Zion. Prior to their conversation, he secretly ordered a cake to be delivered to a woman sitting across from their table. While she received her cake - sensually indulging in it, The Merovingian elaborated about the concept of causality to Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus.</p>
            <br>
            <p>He explained that every cause has an effect, and every effect has a cause. Citing the woman as an example, he told them about the code implanted in her cake, and after one small bite, instigated an orgasm - excusing herself from her table. After she left, The Merovingian told Neo that The Keymaker is subjected to his ownership, and no one can communicate or interact with him. His intentions were to block the Nebuchadnezzar crew from obtaining The Keymaker to reach the Source; at this point in the narrative, is implied as central computing core of The Matrix.</p>

            <br>
            <p>After The Merovingian left to use the washroom, Persephone betrayed him and guided Neo and the others to The Keymaker for his liberation. In the process, she killed Abel with a silver bullet and told Cain, who had witnessed it, to go tell The Merovingian what she had done; both rogue programs were once salvaged by The Merovingian, and were very old and "difficult to kill."

            <p>Upon hearing what had happened, The Merovingian went to the chateau to monitor The Keymaker, finding that the others had released him and Persephone had assisted - just as Cain explicated. Fervently confronting them, Persephone taunted him about causality and also implied that she knew that he had received fellatio from the woman he seduced earlier in the washroom, and departs from the imminent conflict - leaving him to contend with Neo and the others.

            <p>Enraged at the culminating events, The Merovingian ordered The Twins to retrieve The Keymaker. As The Keymaker fled from The Twins, Morpheus and Trinity followed while The Merovingian ordered six of his henchmen to fight Neo.</p>

            <br>
            <p>After Neo defeated his henchmen, The Merovingian - after bitterly cussing out Persephone for her insubordination, muttered under his breath that "this" - the fight, will not be "the end of [Merovingian]". He subsequently explicated to Neo that he has survived his predecessors as he will survive against Neo. The Merovingian vacated through the entrance door and, though Neo attempted to impede him, managed to escape by entering a separate room, as well as rectifying the code to have the door he left through be changed to a cliffside.
